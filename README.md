# Inato Take-Home Test Specification

You are a new developer in the Inato team, and your first job is to add a feature to an old existing piece of code.
We recommend spending between 1 hour and 2 hours on the exercise. (Do more if you like ðŸ˜‡, do less if you think you've shown what you wantðŸ˜Ž)

## System specifications

Hi and welcome to the team. We are in the future, and Inato has extended its activities by opening a pharmacy. Your task is to add a new feature to our system so that we can begin distributing a new drug. First an introduction to our system:

- All drugs have an `expiresIn` value which denotes the number of days we have until the item expires.
- All drugs have a `benefit` value which denotes how powerful the drug is.
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every drug

But there is more:

- Once the expiration date has passed, Benefit degrades twice as fast.
- The Benefit of an item is never negative.
- "Herbal Tea" actually increases in Benefit the older it gets. Benefit increases twice as fast after the expiration date.
- The Benefit of an item is never more than 50.
- "Magic Pill" never expires nor decreases in Benefit.
- "Fervex", like Herbal Tea, increases in Benefit as its expiration date approaches. Benefit increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Benefit drops to 0 after the expiration date.

We have recently signed a supplier of "Dafalgan". This requires an update to our system:

- "Dafalgan" degrades in Benefit twice as fast as normal drugs.

## Instructions

- [x] Fork this repository
- [ ] Implement the required feature
- [ ] Publish it on GitHub as a pull-request
- [ ] Send us the link and tell us approximatively how much time you spent on this assignment

- [x] You are encouraged to refactor the existing code before adding your own, as you would do if this was a real task in real life. 
- [x] We strongly recommend that you write tests to help you during this process.

- [x] Feel free to make any changes to the `updateBenefitValue` method implementation and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not break the public API of the `Drug` and `Pharmacy` classes, as those are used by other pieces of the software (you can add new methods though).

Please commit as frequently as possible to make the review easier.

## Test

To make sure that you will not break anything in the existing code, we added a log of the simulation in the _output.txt_ file. Make sure that your code is able to generate the same file. You can generate a new file by running one of the following commands:

```sh
yarn start
```

```sh
docker-compose up
```

TODO: 
- Tests should be refactored to reduce test file size using
[https://jestjs.io/fr/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout]()
- Drug behavior should be managed in each drug class
